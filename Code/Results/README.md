# Results from Testing 

After running the test script to test the performance of the model, an excel file will auto-generate into this folder as 'model_results.xlsx'. Opening this file will give you the ability to view how well the model predicted. You will see the file path of each audio file, the true class of each file, along with the class the model predicted during testing.
