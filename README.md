# Final Project - UrbanSounds8K

## Introduction

For my final project, I decided to work with a Deep Speech topic. I have always been interested in creating a neural network to train an accurate model using audio files and speech recognition. For this project, I decided to work on a dataset called UrbanSounds8K, which is an audio classification problem. In order to complete this project, there are multiple steps that need to be accomplished: understanding the dataset, what an audio file looks like when initially reading one in, data preprocessing, implementing a neural network, defining the architecture of a neural network, training and validating the model, and finally, testing the performance of the model. With completing all of these steps, the goal is to create and implement the best neural network to classify any and all sound files, and that is what I set out to do. 


## About This Repository

### 1. Code

The Code directory contains all of the code that I wrote to complete the project. In there, you will find a training script, a testing script, an analysis script, and even more information regarding the implementation and execution of a Deep Speech problem. To see the code, please click [here](https://github.com/tristinjohnson/Final-Project-Group2/tree/main/Code).

### 2. Final Project Proposal

This directory contains a my proposal for the final project. Included is a pdf file outlining multiple aspects of the project, along with what I set out to achieve. To view the proposal, click [here](https://github.com/tristinjohnson/Final-Project-Group2/blob/main/Group-Proposal/Final%20Project%20Group%20Proposal.pdf).

### 3. Final Project Presentation

This directory contains my presentation of the project, and includes an overview of the project as a whole. From data preprocessing to my results after testing the model, to multiple diagrams and graphs to display, it is all there.
